I created a webpage to figure out how to store a user's name. HTML was used for building the page structure, and that includes an input field and buttons. CSS was used to make the page more visually appealing. JavaScript was used to handle user interactions and most importantly use the browser's Local Storage. I implemented saving the name when the 'Save' button was clicked and fetching it during the page's refresh. In doing this project, I was taught how to get a webpage to remember stuff, which is a basic rule of web programming. I worked harder to alter the Document Object Model (DOM) so the name being shown would be reloaded. In general, this task provided a hands-on experience in client-side data storage and front-end web development basics.
